# crosshairs

Simple reimplementation of a full screen crosshair functionality for macos.

A dynamic crosshair follows the mouse cursor with reasonable performance similar to the crosshair functionality in Cadence IC Design Environment.

On Windows PowerToys has this functionality, so far every solution failed what I've found on mac.

At this stage every parameter is hardcoded to my liking, once I have the time I will make a settings pane for it on the menubar. PRs welcome in that regard, I have zero experience with Swift and mac dev in general.
